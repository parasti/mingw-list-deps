The Makefile installs to ~/bin by default, so you may need to add that
directory to PATH.  Make sure to read the Makefile, because some of
the variables may (and most likely will) need to be adjusted for your
system.  You can also set a different install path there.  The
variables are documented at the top of the file, so changing them
should be fairly easy even for someone who's never edited a Makefile
or a shell script before.

To install, use "make install".  Uninstall with "make uninstall".
